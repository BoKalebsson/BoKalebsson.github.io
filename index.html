          Java – Cultivating Clean Code and Scalable Growth
        </p>
        <p class="card__quote">
          As part of my journey into full-stack development, I'm currently diving deep into the fundamentals and practices of Java programming. While still in the early stages, I’m actively learning object-oriented programming, clean code principles, and how to build robust, maintainable applications using tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Maven.
        </p>
       <p class="card__quote">
          Through a structured course, I’m gaining hands-on experience with Java syntax, data structures, and common frameworks, while also working on small-scale projects that simulate real-world development workflows. As I progress, this section will grow to include links to projects and code samples that showcase my understanding and evolution as a Java developer.

          My journey into web development began with learning how the web works from the ground up. I'm currently focused on writing semantic HTML and styling responsive layouts using CSS. I’m exploring layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid, and gaining hands-on experience with tools like Visual Studio Code and browser dev tools.

          Cybersecurity – Strength Rooted in Awareness
        </p>
        <p class="card__quote">
          Cybersecurity has quickly become one of the most fascinating aspects of my transition into tech. While I'm still at the beginning of my learning journey, I'm developing a broad understanding of how digital systems are protected—and where they are vulnerable. Platforms like TryHackMe have helped me explore key topics like network structure, user permissions, and basic vulnerability awareness in an interactive way, though my hands-on experience is still growing.
        </p>
        <p class="card__quote">
          So far, I’ve been introduced to core cybersecurity concepts such as system hardening, secure coding practices, and how data travels across networks. I'm learning to think critically about risks, privacy, and the importance of building software with security in mind from the very first line of code. As I continue my training, I aim to build a solid security mindset that will inform every part of my development work, whether I’m writing backend logic or shaping user interfaces.

          <b>Background:</b><br>After several years of working as a chef and in sales — roles that taught me a lot about working under pressure, problem-solving, and communication, I realized I wanted to do something different. I've always been curious about technology and how things work behind the scenes, so I made the decision to change direction and start my journey toward becoming a fullstack developer.

        <p class="card__quote">
          <b>Studying:</b><br>I'm currently studying to become a Fullstack Developer with a focus on Java. The course covers everything from building user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to backend development in Java. Along the way, we’ve also built a strong foundation in tools like Git and GitHub, which we use daily to collaborate and manage our code. It’s a hands-on and fast-paced learning experience — and I’m really enjoying the process.
        </p>
        <p class="card__quote">
          <b>Portfolio:</b><br>I created this portfolio to document my journey into tech and to share what I’ve been learning along the way. It’s a space where I can showcase the projects I’ve worked on, especially in areas I find exciting or want to explore more. For me, it’s not just about showing finished results — it’s also about tracking progress and staying curious.
